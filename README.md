> A command line tool to add your music and videos directly to several devices.

## Why?

Almost all of us use youtube for our music purposes, whether it is a new single released by Eminem or an old classic by Queen. 

Scenario : You need to travel the next day and you realise that the `diff` between your offline mobile playlist and youtube playlist is too large.

Now you have to use an online mp3 converter to convert all the songs one by one, and then connect your device via USB to paste all the music. That too without the metadata.

There is a need for a tool which would directly download and convert the video, add available metadata and send it to your device, all at the same time.

### Enters *MobOff*.

## Features

* Download the best available audio, or video (by `--video` option) in common mobile player compatible extensions.
* Playlists can also be downloaded.
* Adds metadata automatically from the title.
* Add a preffered device to send music, or override it with `--newdevice` option.
* Delete the downloaded video/music file from the computer via `--delete` option.
* Send the downloaded video/music file to your friends via the `--send` option.

## How to use?

(Tested on Ubuntu with Python 3)

>The initial setting up of the Pushbullet account seems a little tiring but it is just a one-time setup, and the gains are endless.

1. You need a [Pushbullet](https://www.pushbullet.com/) account to send the files. 

Pushbullet is a great tool for sending text messages, links, files and seeing phone's notifications on your computer.

  * Create your account on it using your Google or Facebook login.
  * Install the Pushbullet App on your iOS or Android device.
  * Install the Chrome/Firefox extension for Pushbullet on your computer.

2. You need to install `ffmpeg` and `tkinter`.
  * Installing ffmpeg :  `sudo apt-get install ffmpeg`
  * Installing tkinter( for python3 users ) :  `sudo apt-get install python3-tk` 
  * Installing tkinter( for python2 users ) :  `sudo apt-get install python-tk`

3. After setting Pushbullet up, you need to install MobOff.

It is recommended that you use `virtualenv` (especially for `conda` users).

  * Installing `virtualenv` : ` sudo pip install virtualenv`
  * `virtualenv venv --python=python3`
  * `. venv/bin/activate`
  * `python setup.py install`

3. You need to initialise with some of your information.
  
  * Run `moboff initialise`
  * Obtain your Pushbullet API key via [Pushbullet Settings](https://www.pushbullet.com/#settings/account) by clicking on "Create Access Token" button.
  * Enter the serial number for your preffered device to send the music/video files to when asked to.
  * When prompted enter the directory in which you want the downloaded files should be stored.
